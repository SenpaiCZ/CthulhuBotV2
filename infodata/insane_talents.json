{
   "Insane strength":"'I draw upon untold reserves of inner strength!' Gain a bonus die to a STR roll. If the roll is failed, something goes wrong. The Keeper chooses: either the hero is injured (take 1D3 + the hero's damage bonus in damage from torn muscles and the like), or the thing that the hero was working on breaks.",
   "Insane dexterity":"'My hands move quicker than the eye can see!' Gain a bonus die to a DEX roll. If the roll is failed, something goes wrong. The Keeper chooses: either the hero is injured (take 1D4 hit points of damage), or they break the thing that they were working on.",
   "Insane power":"'I can feel the power flowing through me!' Gain a bonus die to a POW roll. If the roll is failed, something goes wrong. The Keeper chooses: either the hero passes out, or the effect they were trying to achieve is dangerously greater than intended.",
   "Insane constitution":"'I grit my teeth and feel no pain!' When an amount of damage is suffered, the hero may choose to make a CON roll. If successful, they bear the pain and halve the damage. If the roll is failed, they take the damage that was rolled and fall to the ground, incapacitated for 1D3 rounds.",
   "Insane appearance":"'Damn, I look good baby!' The hero looks somehow very different; this may be purely in their facial expression and posture, or it could be that they take the time to change their clothes and hair to something radically different (clothes don't magically change-they must do that). Gain a bonus die to an APP roll or roll that could be affected by their appearance, such as Charm or Fast Talk. The effect is short-lived but may be applied to all interactions during a period of time, such as one scene or one meeting. If a roll is failed using the bonus die for their 'improved' appearance, they suffer some form of social disgrace or consequence.",
   "Insane recall":"'I remember everything perfectly!' Every memory and fact the hero ever heard is right at their fingertips. Faces, figures, and details crowd their mind in a flood of information. Gain a bonus die to an EDU, Know, or skill roll when trying to remember information that the hero might feasible have once heard or seen. If a roll is failed, the flood of information is too much! Lose a point of Sanity and suffer a bout of madness. If the hero was not already insane, they are now temporarily insane.",
   "Insane speed":"'Look at me-I'm faster than a speeding bullet!' When entering a chase, the hero takes a bonus die on their CON roll to determine their movement speed. If the roll succeeds, increase their speed by 1. If the roll is an Extreme success, increase their speed by 2. If the roll is failed, they blunder somehow, losing at least 1D3 rounds of movement.",
   "Insane driver":"'Nothing's going to stop me now!' Gain a bonus die to all the hero's Drive rolls for one chase. Should a drive roll fail, they lose control of the vehicle somehow (at the Keeper's discretion).",
   "Insane language":"'Nope, never had a Swahili lesson in my life, but how difficult can it be?' The hero gains a temporary grasp of all modern languages-or one archaic or Mythos language-for a short time. This effect lasts long enough to conduct an initial reading of a tome, conduct a conversation, or listen to a speech. The effective skill in the language is 75%. Should a skill roll be required for the use of the new language, a failed roll means the hero forgets their native tongue for 1D6 days, replacing it with the new language that was being used at the time.",
   "Insane accuracy":"'Seems like I just can't miss!' The hero gains a bonus die to all Firearms rolls until their gun is empty. They may continue to use the bonus die until one of their shots misses its target or they run out of bullets. That missed shot will hit something they do not want it to hit-an ally or something else of great value, dealing damage as if it had been an Extreme success (impale).",
   "Insanely intimidating":"'You think I'm funny? Funny how?' The hero gains a bonus die to Intimidate rolls. If a roll is failed, they lose control of their actions for a short time. The Keeper chooses what happens: either they fly into a violent rage (possibly causing damage to the person they're speaking with), or they are belittled and shamed.",
   "Insanely hard to hit":"'Float like a butterfly!' The hero gains a bonus die on all Dodge rolls in the current combat scene until they fail a Dodge roll. Such a failure indicates moving into the blow, in which case they receive damage as if the attack had achieved an Extreme success.",
   "Insane sense of direction":"'Follow me, it's down here!' The hero's player tells the Keeper where they want to go or what they want to head towards. The Keeper gives the direction they should take in order to accomplish this. The hero makes a Luck roll: if the roll is failed, they walk straight into a trap or dangerous encounter of some kind.",
   "Insane understanding":"'Oh, I get it now!' The hero's player may ask the Keeper a question about the plot: 'Why is the enemy doing ... ?' 'What does the enemy hope to achieve by ... ?' 'What is the best thing that we could do to thwart the enemy's plan?' 'What is the enemy's greatest weakness?' The question should be quite specific and the Keeper should answer honestly. This talent can only be used once-it is then lost.",
   "Insane vision":"'Light? Who needs light?' The hero gains a bonus die to a Spot Hidden roll. Even in complete darkness, they get to make a roll as if it were twilight. If the roll is failed, the Keeper decides the outcome: either their eyes become painful and overly sensitive (effectively leaving them blind for 1D10 rounds) or they suffer delusions for the next hour.",
   "Insane hearing":"'Quiet everyone, what's that ticking?' The hero gains a bonus die to a Listen roll. Regardless of ambient noise or other sounds, they are able to pick up on even the quietest of sounds. If the roll is failed, the Keeper decides what happens: either some sudden noise leaves them deaf for 1D10 minutes, or they have auditory delusions for the next hour.",
   "Insane stealth":"'You ain't seen me, right?' The hero gains a bonus die to a Stealth roll. They move with catlike grace and might even attempt to hide in plain sight. If the roll is failed, they accidentally break something or cause a great deal of commotion.",
   "Insane brutality":"'I'm gonna chop you into tiny pieces!' The hero rolls all melee damage twice and takes the highest result. The downside is that once they start hitting, they cannot stop! They must continue until they deliver a killing blow. The only two things that will stop this is if they are either rendered unconscious or someone successfully makes a Hard Fast Talk, Charm, or Intimidate roll on them (only one person may attempt one of these on the hero in any one combat round).",
   "Insane skill augmentation":"'You think I'm crazy don't you? But it's possible I tell you!' As a side effect of insanity, a hero can augment one of their skills (of the player's choice, agreed by the Keeper) with some aspect of the Cthulhu Mythos. This will affect the scope of what can be achieved with the skill. Herbert West and Crawford Tillinghast are both good candidates for case studies on how this might affect a person."
